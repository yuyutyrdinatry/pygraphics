# Installing JES under Windows #

If you are using Windows instead of Linux then there may be a couple of hoops to jump over in order to call 'make'. But worry not! Here is a quick and dirty way to compile JES is such a scenario.

  * Check out JES from SVN (see mail for the url)
  * Copy the directory Source someplace else
  * Create a separate Java Eclipse project on it
  * Added the jar files from the original SVN project
  * Eclipse will now compile it :)
  * Copy and overwrite the original Source directory that now contains all the neccerary Java byte code
  * Enjoy!

The action is equivalent to that of calling 'make fast'
