Due to various issues, the project has been forked.  There is a JES-
compatible version in branch "BeforeSummer07".  The current version has these major
features:

  * Indexing will be 0-based instead of 1-based
  * camelCase will switch to pothole\_case
  * sound and video features have been (temporarily) removed
  * The library will be based on PIL, in order to avoid some Tkinter issues that crop up in most Python IDEs.
