# The Project #

The `PyGraphics` project aims to provide Media Computation technology for use in introductory computer science courses at the University of Toronto. This technology consists of a simplified multimedia framework originally written by Mark Guzdial for use in his introductory Computational Media course CS1315/16 in the College of Computing at the Georgia  Institute of Technology. This multimedia library allows first year students to better learn basic computing concepts through the manipulation of images, sounds, and videos through the Python programming language. In addition, the library provides professors and teaching assistants with a means to create simple interactive demonstrations to augment the traditional means of teaching.


# Features #

`PyGraphics` aims to translate the new features of Media Computation from its JPython version to CPython. We have implemented support for image and sound manipulation; the module provides tools for performing the following tasks:

  * Creating and resizing pictures
  * Drawing lines and polygons
  * Adding text to images
  * Modifying individual pixels' colours (RGB values)
  * Creating, editing, and merging sound clips
  * Drawing the waveform graph of a sound


Future development will provide video manipulation tools, as well as simple 3D capabilities.

We have inherited the media.py file from the Georgia development Team 7, and base our effort on their previous work.
